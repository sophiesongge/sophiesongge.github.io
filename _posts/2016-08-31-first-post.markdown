This is my first post. My reviewer told me that the deviation of (A^x)
 equals to $x \\cdot A^ \( x-1 \)$ !!!!!! What the fuck is wrong with him????? I would really like to ask him
  what was the chips brand of the bag where he found his PhD diploma! Oh, Actually the high school one!!

I would kindly remind my readers that the right answer should be: $A^x \\cdot lnA$.
