This is my first post. My reviewer told me that the derivation of (A^x)
 equals to $x \\cdot A^ {x-1}$ !!!!!! What should I say? I would really like to ask him
  what was the chips brand of the bag where he found his PhD diploma! Oh, actually the high school one!! :P

I would kindly remind my readers that the right answer should be: $A^x \\cdot lnA$. =^-^=
