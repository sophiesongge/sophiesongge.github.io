This is my first post. My reviewer told me that the deviation of $$A^x$$
 equals to $$x \\cdot A^\\(x-1\\)$$ !!!!!! What the fuck is wrong with him????? I would really like to ask him
  what was the chips brand of the bag where he found his PhD diploma! Oh, Actually the high school one!!

I would kindly remind my readers that:



I would like to remind the deviation of A^x equals to A^x lnA, not xA^(x-1)!!!!!
